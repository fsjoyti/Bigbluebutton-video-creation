# Bigbluebutton-video-creation
This is a  project I have been working on as part of mine work. I am reading from xml file to get the timestamps then I am using ffmpeg to create mpg files of that duration. Then I am combining the files to create a video and then I am combining the resulting video with audio files. Some of the code still needs some polishing.
